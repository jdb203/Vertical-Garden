# Vertical-Garden

This is my open-source vertical garden project that uses 3D printed hardware developed in FreeCAD. These parts are designed to work around a structure made from 1.5" PVC hardware and water delivery via 1/2" PVC plumbing. The water-nutrient tank that the pipe goes into can be a 5 gallon paint bucket or thin plastic tote. Download STL files directory for all the 3D printed parts.
